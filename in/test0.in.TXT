Advanced development of human society was made possible by exploiting the huge 
stocks of energy deposited over millions of years in fossil biomass.
Biomass can be considered as a strategic resource because: it is renewable,
it is accessible to any area, it provides products of vital interest (e.g. food,
feed, raw materials for various industries, biofuels, and others), and it support
the environmental and socio-economic development, providing jobs especially in rural areas
(Epure, 2006). Biomass presents an increasing importance as source of fuels
(solid, liquid and gas). Traditionally, harvested and dry biomass can be used to
produce heat through combustion. There are still zones, in which from different
reasons the biomass represents for the inhabitants the main source of energy available;
available because it exists at their own, and 
they can get it, transport and store with their means (Roman et al., 1996). Modern use
of biomass consists in converting it into biofuel through different complex processes
(gasification, pyrolysis, catalytic liquefaction). Biogas production from agricultural
biomass is of growing importance as it offers considerable environmental benefits (Chynoweth, 2004)
and is an additional source of income for farmers (Amon et al., 2007). Among the crops used
for biogas production, maize is the most important crop (Amon et al., 2007; Balodis, 2011),
which can produce between 205 and 450 m3 of methane per tonne volatile solids (Murphy et al., 2011).
The advantage of maize as C4 crop is less water requirement for plants dry matter production
(Dubrovskis, 2010). However the water stress affects significantly the maize biomass production.
There is a wide response of maize plant to drought according to the cultivated hybrid, respectively
according to the capacity .
